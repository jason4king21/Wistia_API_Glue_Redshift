### üé• Wistia Video Analytics Pipeline with AWS Glue & Redshift

This project implements a full-stack data engineering pipeline that automates the extraction and analysis of video engagement data from the **Wistia Stats API**. The pipeline is orchestrated via **GitHub Actions** and executed nightly using **AWS Glue**, with all transformation logic written in **PySpark**. The processed data is stored in **Amazon S3** in a structured **dimensional model** (`dim_` / `fact_` tables) using the **Parquet** file format.

---

#### üîß Key Project Features

- **CI/CD with GitHub Actions**  
  The Glue job script is managed in a GitHub repository. Each code change is deployed automatically via a GitHub Actions workflow, which uploads the script to S3 and triggers or updates the Glue job definition accordingly.

- **ETL Orchestration with AWS Glue**  
  The Glue script runs nightly and performs the following:
  - Connects to the Wistia APIs using secure token-based authentication.
  - Pulls media-level and visitor-level analytics using Wistia‚Äôs endpoints (media details, engagement metrics, engagement by day, and raw events).
  - Implements pagination and date-based slicing to manage large payloads and optimize API performance.
  - Parses and cleans the data before writing it to S3 in Parquet format, split across logical folders for dimensional modeling (e.g., `dim_media/`, `fact_engagements/`, `fact_events/`, etc.).

- **Data Lake with Amazon S3**  
  All data is stored in a single S3 bucket, partitioned by folder prefixes representing individual dimension and fact tables. The storage is organized to support scalable downstream querying.

- **Metadata Cataloging with Glue Crawler**  
  A separate Glue crawler scans the S3 bucket and updates the AWS Glue Data Catalog with schema definitions, allowing external services like Redshift to query the data directly.

- **Data Warehouse with Amazon Redshift**  
  Redshift is connected to the Glue Catalog using an external schema, enabling analysts to write SQL queries against the raw and aggregated engagement data to generate charts, dashboards, and insights.

- **Extensible for Reporting**  
  The resulting data model supports use cases such as identifying high-performing media, analyzing viewer behavior by geography, and tracking engagement trends over time.

### Components

1. **Wistia Stats API** ‚Äì Provides media, visitor, and event-level engagement data.  
2. **AWS Glue (PySpark)** ‚Äì Fetches and transforms data (media, engagements, events, visitors) nightly with pagination and incremental logic.  
3. **Amazon S3** ‚Äì Single-bucket object storage with folder-based structure (`dim_media`, `fact_engagements`, etc.) in Parquet format.  
4. **AWS Glue Crawler** ‚Äì Catalogs S3 data and registers it into AWS Glue Data Catalog.  
5. **Amazon Redshift** ‚Äì Connects to Glue Catalog as an external schema for querying.  
6. **GitHub Actions** ‚Äì Automates deployment of Glue scripts and crawler execution.

## üîß Tech Stack

- **Python 3.x** ‚Äì Used in Glue job to connect to Wistia API and handle processing  
- **AWS Glue (v3, PySpark)** ‚Äì Batch processing and transformation  
- **Amazon S3** ‚Äì Central data lake bucket with folder-based partitioning  
- **AWS Glue Crawler** ‚Äì Metadata cataloging and schema creation
